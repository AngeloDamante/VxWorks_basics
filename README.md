# VxWorks Basics
This repo represents my first fun approach to Embedded programming. Experience made during the SWE4ES course at the University of Florence using <a href="https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks"> VxWorks </a> RTOS.

In this "projects" are presents two dkm implemented on Wind River Workbench to test semaphores and periodic activations.

## VxWorks
My workstation is used as host with VxSim as target and the system viewer capture the events and allows data exchange between. Reference on <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks"> Wikipedia </a>. 

Windriver allows to create _download kernem modules_ (**DKM**). These are loaded into the target with "target actions for the selected connections" and "load modules".
